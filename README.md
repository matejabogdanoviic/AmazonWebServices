Amazon Web Services - MSSQL database initiative featuring sales analysis alongside user management functionalities

This project uses Microsoft SQL Server to model an e-commerce database for services similar to those offered by Amazon. A collection of intricate queries, views, and stored procedures for order tracking, payment processing, sales analysis, and user management are all included in the schema design.

The primary objectives are to:

Determine the top-selling items and clients by analyzing sales data.

Monitor shipments, orders, and delivery outcomes by shipping zone.

Control user payment options, such as the integration of Amazon Pay

Create sales rankings and spending leaderboards for each category.

Provide protocols for user spending reports and typical payment failure scenarios.
